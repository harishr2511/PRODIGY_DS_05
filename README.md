# Traffic Accident Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing traffic accidents dataset to understand the correlation between various factors such as weather conditions, month, day, time, and accident severity. The analysis focuses on data visualization, data cleaning, and deriving insights from the dataset.

## Introduction

The project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns and correlations with external factors like weather conditions and time of occurrence. This analysis helps in understanding accident trends and improving safety measures.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about traffic accidents, including attributes like weather conditions, month, day, time, latitude, longitude, and accident severity.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involved:

- Handling missing values
- Standardizing data formats
- Filtering and removing irrelevant data points

## Data Analysis

The data analysis phase focused on:

- Correlating accident severity with weather conditions, time of day, and month
- Analyzing trends in accident frequency based on temporal factors

## Visualization

Visualization techniques used include:

- Scatter plots to visualize accident locations (latitude and longitude)
- Bar charts and pie charts to represent accident severity distribution
- Line plots to show temporal trends in accident occurrence

## Results

Insights derived from the analysis include:

- Understanding peak times for accidents based on time of day
- Identifying weather conditions associated with higher accident severity
- Geographic hotspots for accidents based on latitude and longitude data

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the importance of data analysis and visualization in understanding traffic accident patterns. The findings can be used to implement targeted interventions and improve road safety measures.
